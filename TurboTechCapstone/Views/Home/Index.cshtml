                                The best avocados are to be found in the Caribbean and are
                                of the large variety which are allowed to ripen on the tree or on the table or market.
                                The varieties vary as there is the green skin as well as the purple avocado.
                                The flavours are quite distinct and this variety has a creamy buttery taste to it.
                                Shaped similar to a heart, the avocado has a single large seed on the inside,
                                which is brown in colour, this is a outer skin which acts as a cocoon for the
                                seed it covers and is a smaller shape of the north American avocado.
                                The inside is yellow/green colour and is soft and smooth to taste.
                                If you visit the Caribbean in the summer you should ask for the local avocado.
                                The avocado is in the Caribbean are grown on treas which can reach
                                height of 10 to 20 feet. This is the variety which is not genetically
                                modified and grow naturally in the Caribbean, without being cultivated or
                                grown on large farms. A nice addition to salads or with roasted or boiled food,
                                or as a snack. Crushed avocado with olive oil, salt and Reggae For You Pepper sauce

                                Port Royal 8 is our brand of rum cakes and edible wedding favours.
                                There is a long history behind this recipe, but an even longer history behind the name.
                                This recipe was given to me 5 years ago by a dear friend who died a few years later at
                                the age of 92. She insisted that she was too old to bake anymore and wanted me to have
                                the recipe. I remember us having great conversations about her recipes and her family.
                                She insisted that it was more than the recipe and the process was just as important.
                                And by the demand for our cakes, she was right. She was a woman who was determined
                                and one you could not question. She insisted the process of mixing and baking was key
                                to getting the cake delicious and moist. She insisted after baking for 70 years, she
                                knew exactly how itâ€™s to be done. So we have developed our line of product following
                                Aunt Pearlâ€™s recipe and her techniques. And Yes it has paid off from the demands we
                                have been having for this product. So Aunt Pearl, you were absolutely right. Every
                                cake is baked using Aunt Pearlâ€™s recipes and her technique. She insisted she baked
                                the best cake. Choosing a name for Aunt Pearlâ€™s rum cake was no easy task. We thought
                                the longevity of this recipe just like the history of Port Royal have their unique charms.
                                So Aunt Pearl, hereâ€™s to your new Port Royal Rum Cake. Once home to pirates Port Royal
                                became the most important shipping port in the Caribbean and the center of shipping commerce.
                                Pirates from around the world would congregate there. Itâ€™s residents included infamous
                                pirates such as Captain Mortan, Calico Jackâ€¦. founded in 1516, Port Royal was destroyed by
                                a powerful earthquake in 1692. The city slipped into the sea and remains buried there to this
                                day. It was rebuilt and again destroyed in an earthquake in 1907. That structure also slipped into
                                the sea. Natgeotv in Wicked Pirate City shows the underwater detail of the sunken city. Now a quiet
                                historic fishing town. There is an application to UNESCO Heritage for the town to become an historical
                                site, similar to the Pyramids of Egypt. But if you want tasty, fresh fish. This is the best place to
                                go from the sea to the table, your fish is caught daily. So Visit Gloriaâ€™s in Port Royal and enjoy
                                fresh flavourful sea food. Our Port Royal 8 brand of Jamaican Rum Cake brings to you the taste of

                                She is now 87 years old. She was always cooking. I counted she has been cooking for over 70 years. I can recall the house always being full. You see my grandparents had 12 children so Mama when she was not washing and cleaning she was always in the kitchen. I will never forget her Tasty. Delicious. Mouth watering cooking. Sometimes my uncles would tease that Mama would not have to wash some of the dishes because they were licked clean. When I look back I fondly recall when she would go hunting dinner in the back yard. Sunday dinner was sometimes chicken and rice and peas. The peas Papa would bring home. Mama was a savvy and sophisticated woman and was not afraid to use her line of credit, she did so sparingly when she had to. One of the children, me included would be sent to Miss Vieâ€™s shop to tell her Mama wanted rice. This would be written in a book and we would be given the rice to take home. Sunday dinner was on! We would be sent shopping after Mama had started dinner and be told to hurry back. We would stop on the way to play and then would see grandma coming to the gate and start rushing, telling her, we just got through. She always knew we were lying as she could hear us laughing and playing. On other occasions, dinner would be shared with our guest, and sometimes, not much was left. We would be told family came by and they could not leave without joining us for dinner. On other occasions, we would get home the kitchen would be clean and tidy and all the dishes would be turned down. Grandma would send us off to bed early, insisting we had to be up early for school. We could not always go to bed immediately and the radio would be turned on, my grandparents, aunts and uncles would start chatting and joking until everyone was fast asleep. I canâ€™t help but have fond memories of a happy childhood, with Mamaâ€™s cooking and living with so many aunts and uncles and Papa. My grandmother, whom I call Mama has been my inspiration in developing our recipes. She always said keep it simple and flavourful and never give away your secret in business. Make sure everyone is always satisfied. This is what drives me. We want you to be satisfied so we use only the best ingredients, bringing out great flavours in our products. So say the lady who has been cooking for over 70 years. I canâ€™t help but be inspired by a woman who has had 12 children, 8 of whom became teachers and since the 1960s they have taught between 7,000 to 10,000 students in Jamaica. â€œI have never questioned if there was anything I could not doâ€� because Mama always said â€œPut your mind to it, make it happenâ€�. From all of us at Reggae For You. Share your happy childhood story. Donna Will
