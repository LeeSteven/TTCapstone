                                    Ingredients:

                                    •Potato or yam Roast on stove top (gas only).  For quick roasting cover with metal pan or pot

                                    1 Medium sweet potato washed and dried 18 cm long if longer cut (roast both)

                                    How to Do it
                                    1. Stove Top roasting
                                    2. Place sweet potato on low to medium flame and cover with metal bown or stainless steel pot. The dome must cover the entire potato
                                    3. Periodically use kitchen mittens to lift dome and turn potato.
                                    4. Roast for 15 – 20 minutes. Pierce the potato with a form or skewer if the center is soft, it is roasted.
                                    5. Turn flame off. Allow to cool them peal.
                                    6. Oven Roasting/baking.
                                    7. As you will have more space. We recommend you bake several potatoes. Heat oven to 400 degrees

                                    Place washed and dried sweet potatoes on top rack of oven. Set time for 30 – 45 minutes
                                    8. Foil is not recommended as potato will retain too much of the water and make the potato soggy when baked.
                                    9. Turn potato periodically as the top will be the hottest and roast the quickest if not using a convection oven.
                                    10. Eat hot with butter or add as a side to your favourite meal.
